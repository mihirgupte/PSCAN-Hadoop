# PSCAN in Hadoop
A graph clustering algorithm called SCAN implemented in Apache Hadoop by a method called as PSCAN. This algorithm is linear in nature and has complexity of O(m), where m is the number of edges in the graph. <br />

This is an implementation of the paper <br />

which is a MapReduce implementation of the paper <br />

**Note:** There are slight changes in my code which are not present in the PSCAN paper, but the underlying results are same.
